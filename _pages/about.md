## Intro
Good Datasets for AI Model Training in the Power and Energy Domain is the first competition organized by IEEE Power & Energy Society and IEEE DataPort.
This Competition encourages researchers across the power and energy community to contribute high-quality datasets that support AI model training and evaluation for power/energy applications. The competition does not constrain algorithms or model choices. Instead, it emphasizes:
* The importance of the addressed problem and its difficulty of applying AI;
* The dataset’s quality, representativeness, reproducibility, and compliance;
* Reasonable validation on the dataset (e.g., baselines or illustrative experiments).
All submitted datasets **MUST** be hosted on IEEE DataPort and comply with DataPort’s upload and publication policies. All submitted works should consist of two parts: dataset part and report part. The final winner will be determined through the **online defense**.

## Official site
The [official site]() of this competition can be accessed on IEEE DataPort.

## Sponsors & Organizors
We are grateful for the sponsors and colloberations from IEEE PES and DataPort.
