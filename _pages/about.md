## Official site
The [official site]() of this competition can be accessed on IEEE DataPort and news will be updated dynamically on [this site](https://dppescomp.github.io/pesdpcompetition.github.io/).


## Abstract
Application and development of advanced AI models provide pivotal solutions for various power and energy system (PES) issues and challenges. The performance of AI models is heavily dependent on the availability of high-quality datasets. However, such datasets are often insufficiently documented. To address this challenge, we are launching the competition “Good Datasets for AI Model Training in the Power and Energy Domain”, which aims to identify, curate, and promote exemplary datasets that can accelerate research and development in PES. The competition is open to the public, inviting students and researchers at all levels to showcase datasets that demonstrate excellence in quality, relevance, accessibility, and impact on AI-driven solutions for power systems, renewable integration, energy efficiency and security, grid resilience, and sustainability.


## Competition Purpose & Scope
This Competition encourages researchers across the community to **contribute high-quality datasets** that support AI model training and evaluation for challenging problems in PES. The competition **does not constrain targeted questions, algorithms, or model choices**. Instead, it emphasizes:
* The importance of the addressed problem and the technical difficulty of applying AI;
* The dataset’s quality, representativeness, reproducibility, and compliance for AI model training;
* Performance of the AI models trained on the dataset(s).


## Competition procedure
* All submitted works should consist of two parts: the dataset and the corresponding report in IEEE data description [journal style](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10347231).
* All submitted datasets MUST be hosted on [IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/) and comply with DataPort’s upload and publication policies. 


## Sponsors & Organizors
We are grateful for the sponsors and colloberations from IEEE PES and DataPort.
