# Rubric Detail
## Scale
* Each section is scored on **1â€“5**

| Score  | Description                                           |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Poor \(severe deficiencies \/ unusable\)              |
| 2      | Weak \(multiple issues\)                              |
| 3      | Fair \(meets minimum expectations\)                   |
| 4      | Good \(high quality with minor gaps\)                 |
| 5      | Excellent \(clear, complete, reusable, high impact\)  |


## Section weights

| No.    | Section \(<i>S<sub>i</sub></i>\)                      | Weight \(<i>W<sub>i</sub></i>\)  |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1      | Importance of targeted problem <br>\(A good dataset should target a problem of high relevance and impact in the power and energy domain, advancing both research innovation and practical solutions.\)  | 10% |
| 2      | Difficulty of data organization<br>\(The difficulty of data organization reflects the effort required to collect, clean, integrate, and structure the dataset.\)                     | 10% |
| 3      | Accessibility & Usability<br>\(Publicly available, with clear documentation, metadata, and licensing. Organized in standard formats (e.g., MAT, CSV, JSON, HDF5) and easy to integrate into AI workflows.\)  | 20% |
| 4      | Reproducibility & Transparency<br>\(Accompanied by clear instructions, preprocessing steps, and references. Code for data preparation or example use cases is provided.\)  |  20% |
| 5      | AI model performance based on datasets<br>\(A good dataset should enable the efficient learning of AI models and achieve reliable, generalizable, and reproducible performance, demonstrated through benchmarking on relevant tasks.\)  | 30% |
| 6      | Impact potential<br>\(Enables development of robust AI models with measurable improvements. Has potential to accelerate innovation in sustainability, efficiency, reliability, or resiliency.\) | 10% |

## Score

* All-student bonus &#x03B3;=0.25, format penalty p=1, EoI bonus b=0.25.
* Final_score = <math>
  <mrow>
    <mo>&#x03B3; -p + b + </mo>
    <mo>&#x03A3;</mo>
      <i>S<sub>i</sub></i> * <i>W<sub>i</sub></i>
   </mrow></math>

\(\* Students include undergraduate and postgraduate students.\)

\(\*The EoI bonus applies only to EoI form submissions received before the EoI deadline.\)

\(\* Format penalty: submissions do not follow the required formatting, e.g. word/page limit.\)

* Tie-breaking
  
  If a tie occurs, compare in order: \(1\) AI model performance based on datasets \(higher wins\); \(2\) Reproducibility & transparency \(higher wins\); \(3\) Accessibility & usability \(higher wins\).
  
* Disqualification & Deductions
  
  Plagiarism, infringement, data fabrication, or major compliance risks may lead to disqualification. If data/code becomes inaccessible during review or significantly deviates from the report, organizers may deem the submission invalid.
