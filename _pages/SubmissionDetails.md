Regulations of the competition. Any matters not covered herein shall be decided by the committee after deliberation.

# 1 Eligibility & Teaming
* Participation is open to individuals or teams. Each team may have at most 3 members (including the team lead). An extra supervisor is allowed and optional.
* Only one registration per team is required. There is no restriction on members’ institutions.
* All-student teams receive a scoring advantage (see Prizes). An all-student team means all members are enrolled students (undergraduate, master’s, or PhD) on the submission deadline.
* Each participant (including individuals) may join at most one team. Duplicate participation may result in disqualification.



# 2 Evaluation Process
The competition has **two stages**:
* **Stage 1**
  The submitted datasets and reports will be reviewed by the committees, and the Top 5 teams will be selected.
* **Stage 2**
  These **Top 5 teams** will be invited to an online defense, where they will present their datasets. The final winners will be determined based on this defense.


# 3 Review & Compliance Screening
* Administrative/compliance screening: A preliminary check for license, privacy, safety, and accessibility. Submissions failing this step will not enter the review process.
* Reviewer assignment: Each valid submission is randomly assigned to 2-3 reviewers who score independently. Reviewers must declare conflicts of interest and recuse as needed.
* Review approach: Scoring will be based on the submitted dataset and report. Reviewers will verify the availability of datasets and code as necessary, and may conduct spot checks or request further clarifications.
